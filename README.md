# ShoppingCart

We built a Django project to build an online
shop. Our Project will be able to browse through a product catalog
and add products to a shopping cart. Finally, we will be able to
check out the cart and place an order. Our Project will cover the
following functionalities of an online shop.

* Creating the product catalog models, adding them to the
  administration site, and building the basic views to display
  the catalog.

* Building a shopping cart system using Django sessions to
  allow users to keep selected products while they browse the
  site.

* Creating the form and functionality to place orders on the
  site.

* Sending an asynchronous email confirmation to users when
  they place an order
